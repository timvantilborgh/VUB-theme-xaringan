# VUB-theme-xaringan
A css theme for Xaringan presentations using style elements of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB).

The theme is based on the [Rutgers theme by Joseph Casillas](https://github.com/jvcasillas/ru_xaringan). Alterations include:

- Colorscheme of VUB
- Roboto font
- VUB logo added to title slide and closing slide
